## Problem Statement

Cloud BOT has a fleet of devices transmitting daily aggregated telemetry. Standard maintenance procedures, ie routine
 and time-based preventative methods, can be costly.  In order to better manage maintenance costs, implementing
  machine learning-based predictive maintenance techniques could save time and money by allowing technicians to only
   work on devices that are in need of repairs.  A standard classification model utilizing the daily aggregated
    telemetry that is already collected would be the preferable way to tackle this since it doesn't require
     additional data collection and a large database of historical telemetry data is already available.
